sugarcrm-inbound-emails-case-routing
====================================

The three things I wanted to achieve with this customisation are:

1) Customise Cases assignment rules
2) Customise Email assignment rules
3) Be able to notify the case owner that there is a new Email for an existing Case 


You can find all the details on how to use this module on my blog at: http://enricosimonetti.com/customise-sugarcrm-case-assignment-from-inbound-emails/
