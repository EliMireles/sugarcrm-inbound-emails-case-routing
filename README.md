sugarcrm-inbound-emails-case-routing
====================================

The three things I wanted to achieve with this customisation are:

<ol>
<li>Customise Cases assignment rules</li>
<li>Customise Email assignment rules</li>
<li>Be able to notify the case owner that there is a new Email for an existing Case</li>
</ol>


You can find all the details on how to use this module on my blog at: http://enricosimonetti.com/customise-sugarcrm-case-assignment-from-inbound-emails/
